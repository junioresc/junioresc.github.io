# Website Portfolio for Junior Escobar

## Description:
This is my online web portfolio that I am going to present to potential employers. The goal is to make a cool and interesting page that will catch the attention of employers. On the website you'll be able to see a picture of me, and it also has my name along with my phone number, email and social media information. The most important section is the Work tab which will show all the projects I have completed in their deployed state.
Not my best work but this will be updated as I learn more.
